-------------------------------------------------------------------
MDDF tools have three modes of operation:

  > interactively using a Graphic User Interface (GUI)
  > using the Command Line Interface (CLI) with arguments
  > running scripts
  
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
 Using the GUI:

The '-i' (or '--interactive') option is used to start the tools in 
interactive mode. A 'launcher' dialog will be started that allows a
user to then choose the specific MDDF tools to be launched.

When used in interactive mode, all other arguments will be ignored. 
The '-i' argument therefore has precedence over all other arguments.

Example Usage: 
  
  java -jar mddf-tool.jar -i
          
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
 Using the CLI with arguments :
                      
The CLI mode may be used to validate one or more MDDF file. Command line 
options are, therefore, focused mainly on specifying which MDDF file(s)
to process and controlling logging output.

Example Usage:

  (a) java -jar mddf-tool.jar -f ../sample/MyManifest.xml -v  
  
      Validates a single file, prints the log entries to the console, and 
      does not save the log output in a CVS file. Log filtering is not 
      specified so the default level of WARNING or higher is used.
      
  (b) java -jar mddf-tool.jar -f ../sample  logLevel error -l myLogFile
  
     Validates all MDDF files in a directory and filters the log entries
     to only include those with severity ERROR or higher. processing will
     include all subdirectories since the '-r' argument is not specified 
     and defaults to 'T'. When completed, the log output will be saved to 
     "./myLogFile.csv".   
     
  (c) java -jar mddf-tool-f ./Avail_v1.7.xlsx -xDir ./out -x AVAILS_2_2 
  
      Validates a single Avails specified as an Excel spreadsheet using
      the v1.7 template. If the file is valid it will be converted to an
      XML file using the v2.2 schema and then saved in the './out' 
      subdirectory.   
                      
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
 Running scripts (INCOMPLETE):

In this mode the MDDF Validation/Translation toolset is used to run 
validation scripts that specify sets of files to process and the specific
options to use with each file set. Most options that are available
when using the other two modes are supported. Using a script, however, allows
different options to be specified with each file set.

Scripting language and syntax is documented in the User's Guide. See 
http://movielabs.com/md/manifest/validator/v1.2.1/UsersGuide.html#SCRIPT

Example Usage:

  Runs a script with log output saved to to a file:
  
       java -jar mddf-tool.jar  -s ./myScript.xyz
